1: Go in folder "src\data"

2: Open "command prompt" and type "json-server --watch db.json"
it should import json file and start json server

3: Go back to main folder there you can see "src , node_modules etc" folder

4. Open "command prompt" and type "npm run dev"

Hope it will work or let me know then mybe i can come with any other solution
